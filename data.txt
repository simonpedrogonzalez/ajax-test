Here is the data that you needed. Ajax allowed the data to be loaded without having to refresh the hole page.
Ajax helps to develop faster and more interactive web apps, with better performance due to less usage
of server resources. Resources that can be accessed are usually local, or from the same origin.
There are tons of web sites with public API that we could access, but most of them use the default CORS security
setting (by not setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin) which means we can only access their API from the command line
or from the server and not from the browser.
One of the few exceptions is the API from github, we can access their data via ajax request (press the other button).
