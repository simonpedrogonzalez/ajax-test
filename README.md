# Ajax example
Super simple ajax example to get to understand its main advantage.
## Getting Started
Just opening the http wont work, the browser will block the ajax requests. Instead we will have to run a web server. Using nodejs and npm: 
1. run this command:
"npm install". 
This will install lite-server (defined in package.json), a static server that loads index.html in your default browser and auto refreshes it when application files change.
2. Start the local web server! run this command:
"npm start". 
Wait a second and index.html is loaded and displayed in your default browser served by your local web server!
### Prerequisites
Node.js, npm
